This was done by integrating quality-controlled interactions of human proteins with a validated, computationally derived phenotype similarity score, permitting identification of previously unknown complexes likely to be associated with disease. Using a phenomic ranking of protein complexes linked to human disease, we developed a Bayesian predictor that in 298 of 669 linkage intervals correctly ranks the known disease-causing protein as the top candidate, and in 870 intervals with no identified disease-causing gene, provides novel candidates implicated in disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa, epithelial ovarian cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. Our publicly available draft of protein complexes associated with pathology comprises 506 complexes, which reveal functional relationships between disease-promoting genes that will inform future experimentation.},

This review summarizes the knowledge on {GC} cytotoxicity in leukemia. The relevance of polymorphisms, splice variants and the number and regulation of the {GC} receptor are discussed. The role of multidrug resistance proteins, glutathione and glutathione S-transferase is evaluated, as well as the influence of the different heat-shock chaperone (hsp 90 and 70) and co-chaperone proteins ({BAG-1} and others) which form a complex together with the {GC} receptor. Finally, the transactivation and transrepression (via {NF-kappa} B and {AP-1} binding) of a wide range of genes (like c-myc) which initiates the final apoptosis pathway are discussed and suggestions for future directions of research in {ALL} patients are given.},

	abstract = {Ascertaining the impact of uncharacterized perturbations on the cell is a fundamental problem in biology. Here, we describe how a single assay can be used to monitor hundreds of different cellular functions simultaneously. We constructed a reference database or "compendium" of expression profiles corresponding to 300 diverse mutations and chemical treatments in S. cerevisiae, and we show that the cellular pathways affected can be determined by pattern matching, even among very subtle profiles. The utility of this approach is validated by examining profiles caused by deletions of uncharacterized genes: we identify and experimentally confirm that eight uncharacterized open reading frames encode proteins required for sterol metabolism, cell wall function, mitochondrial respiration, or protein synthesis. We also show that the compendium can be used to characterize pharmacological perturbations by identifying a novel target of the commonly used drug dyclonine.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have markedly different treatment responses and overall outcome. The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70–80\% of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used {DNA} microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases ('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of {BRCA1} carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.},

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ({GSEA)} for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how {GSEA} yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, {GSEA} reveals many biological pathways in common. The {GSEA} method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},
