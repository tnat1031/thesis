\begin{abstract}
The Connectivity Map (CMap) is a database of gene expression signatures obtained from experiments in which cultured human cells are treated with pharmacologic and genomic perturbagens. A typical use case of this database is for a researcher to query with a signature of a cell state of interest and use the matching perturbagens to develop a functional hypothesis for follow-up. 

Current pattern matching algorithms that perform CMap queries suffer from a universal weakness -- the enormous size and richness of signatures in CMap means that a query typically generates hundreds of strong correlations which are hard to distinguish thereby making prioritization on the basis of a distance metric difficult.

We hypothesize that one mode of prioritization is to highlight query results that are highly interconnected amongst themselves over singletons. The goal of this work is to provide a web-based tool for implementing an interconnectivity-based method of query result refinement and of visualizing CMap query results in a graph layout.
