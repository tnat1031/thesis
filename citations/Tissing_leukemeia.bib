	abstract = {Glucocorticoids ({GC)} are probably the most important drugs in the treatment of {ALL.} Despite the extensive use of {GC} for many years, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance. This review summarizes the knowledge on {GC} cytotoxicity in leukemia. The relevance of polymorphisms, splice variants and the number and regulation of the {GC} receptor are discussed. The role of multidrug resistance proteins, glutathione and glutathione S-transferase is evaluated, as well as the influence of the different heat-shock chaperone (hsp 90 and 70) and co-chaperone proteins ({BAG-1} and others) which form a complex together with the {GC} receptor. Finally, the transactivation and transrepression (via {NF-kappa} B and {AP-1} binding) of a wide range of genes (like c-myc) which initiates the final apoptosis pathway are discussed and suggestions for future directions of research in {ALL} patients are given.},
